What is the Strategy Pattern?
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms (strategies),
encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
It lets you change an object’s behavior at runtime without modifying its code.

When to Use It
Use the Strategy pattern when:
You have multiple ways of performing a similar task (e.g., different sorting algorithms, payment methods, or compression strategies).
You want to avoid a lot of if-else or switch statements that choose behavior.
You need to change the behavior of a class dynamically.

Structure
Strategy Interface — defines a common interface for all algorithms.
Concrete Strategies — implement the algorithm in different ways.
Context — maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates behavior to it.

Benefits
Open/Closed Principle: Add new strategies without modifying existing code.
Avoids conditional logic: Replaces if-else blocks with polymorphism.
Runtime flexibility: You can change the algorithm dynamically.

Drawbacks
Increases the number of classes (one per strategy).
The client must know what strategies are available.

Real-world Examples
Java’s Comparator interface (Collections.sort(list, comparator) uses a strategy).
Payment gateways, sorting algorithms, or data compression formats.
